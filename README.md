## Todo Application

This project aims for a basic todo application that has the following features:

- Add todos
- Remove todos
- View todos
- Update todos
### Current Progress
The project has a solid backend which has endpoints to add todos, mark todos as completed and view todos. It also implies input validation, authentication using jwt and a database to make the changes persistent. It also has a basic frontend which is supposed to be broken because the backend went through a lot of changes.
### Tech Stack
- Express
- Zod
- Mongoose
- jsonwebtokens
- javascript
- React
### Setup
- fork the repository locally
- for setting up the backend, go the the backend folder and do a "npm install" to install all the repostories
- for setting up the frontend, go to the frontend folder and do the same as above.
